# customer-Behavior-Analysis-for-Restaurant
<h1>Project overview</h1>

 Danny, a passionate lover of Japanese cuisine, took a step at the beginning of 2021 by opening "Danny's Diner," a cozy restaurant serving his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen.

 Danny’s Diner is in need of my assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
 Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his 
 customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

 He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

 Danny has provided has with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these ex amples are enough for to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!


<h1>Dataset</h1>

1. <b>Sales</b>: contains details about customer,what they ordered and when they ordered.
  
2. <b>Menu</b>: conatins Menu items name with their prices.
